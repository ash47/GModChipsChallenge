Garry's Mod Chips Challenge
=====

###About Garry's Mod Chips Challenge###
 - This is another Chips Challenge clone I wrote, this time, written in GMod Lua, it has both a top down, and first person view.
 - I use a heavily modified version of [GM Lua] (https://code.google.com/p/gmlua/), looking at what I now know about Lua, the implementation is pretty dodgy, and doesn't really interface with GameMaker very well at all.
 - This was written before I knew how to use the mesh library, if I remade this, I would build the levels as a mesh, instead of spawning an entity for each block.

###How close to the original is this?###
 - Most of the stuff is implemented, and works quite well, I don't think I ever implemented teleporters, which makes many levels impossible to beat, and I'm unsure if I finished the switch system.
 - It supports multiple players, but it's not done very well, one person can potentially take a key, and then that's GG.
